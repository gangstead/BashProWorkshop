Look over the list of command commands and familiarize yourself with the man pages. Always check the man pages when you have questions. You can navigate the man pages simply with your arrow keys, page up/down or you can search for a pattern by entering `/` followed by the pattern you're searching for then enter. You might find that the commands you were already familiar with did a lot more than you thought.

Write a script that defines a variable to `hello` and prints `hello world` if the variable is equal to `hello`. If it's not equal to hello have it print `goodbye`.

###### 3 <a id="3"></a>

Try to think of a useful script that would be useful to your own workflow and incorporate an if block. If you can't think of anything then just PRACTICE!

If you've got a complex if block going, try to convert it to a case. Note: cases can take many values for each case separated by the pipe symbol `|`.
