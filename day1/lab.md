###### Exercise 1 <a id="1"></a>

Find out what version of Bash you have installed. Hint: Use the manual pages to find out more about commands and programs. For example:

```sh
$ man <command>
```

###### Exercise 2 <a id="2"></a>

Write a script that declares a variable `name` with a value of `world` and print `hello world` utilizing variable expansion.

###### Exercise 3 <a id="3"></a>

Extend [Exercise 2](#2) and conditionally print `Hello World`. If the variable holds a value of `world` you will need to uppercase it. You will need to google this one.

> Hint: This particular feature is only available in bash 4+. Some of you (like me) will need to `brew install bash` and open a new shell to get the updates.

###### BONUS <a id="bonus"></a>

Repeat the above using a case block.

> Note: cases can take many values for each case separated by the pipe symbol `|`.
